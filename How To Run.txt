- Webclient -
Have Node installed
Open a command prompt in the Webclient directory
Run 'npm run start'
A browser window should open on localhost
(Chrome works better than Firefox, from our tests)


- Server -
Use preferred editor/IDE to run the Java project and/or its tests
Hosted webserver should redirect to the webclient URL


- Graphtool -
Install LÃ–VE
Open a command prompt in the GraphGenerator directory
Run 'lovec .'
Output will be saved in '%appdata%/LOVE/GraphGenerator/graph.json'
